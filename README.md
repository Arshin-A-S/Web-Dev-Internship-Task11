# Task 11: Responsive Layout with CSS Grid
In this task, I implemented a robust, 2D layout system using CSS Grid. This project demonstrates the transition from simple linear flows to complex, responsive dashboard-style architectures.

## Key Accomplishments
* Grid Areas Implementation: Used grid-template-areas to create a named layout, making the CSS highly readable and easy to restructure.

* Mobile-First Strategy: Designed the initial layout for small screens (single column) and used media queries to expand into a multi-column desktop view.

* Hybrid Layouts: Combined CSS Grid for the macro-layout (header, sidebar, footer) and Flexbox for micro-layouts (cards within the main content) to achieve maximum control.

* Responsive Units: Utilized the fr unit and minmax() functions to ensure the main content area expands dynamically while the sidebar remains fixed.

* Device Testing: Optimized spacing and alignment using browser DevTools to simulate various screen widths from mobile to ultra-wide monitors.
